# Arnold Musandu

**Platform / Backend Engineer** building and operating high-traffic systems from Nairobi.
Currently helping scale **Tucheze** to **170K+ users**, with a focus on **database performance, infrastructure efficiency, and reliable deployments**.

I care about systems that are fast, observable, cost-efficient, and boring in production.
